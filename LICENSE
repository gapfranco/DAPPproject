After doing all the passes, it issued another error: `Error: Mnemonic invalid or undefined`

I double and tripled checked the mneumonic codes from my Metamask wallet. It's correect.
Then I exited Truffle and called it again. Now, the same old error:

```
Running migration: 1_initial_migration.js
  Deploying Migrations...
Error encountered, bailing. Network state unknown. Review successful transactions manually.
insufficient funds for gas * price + value
```

I though that perhaps i'm realy out of funds (my wallet has 0.13 ethers in rinkeby) but could
not get more ether. So I tried ropsten where I had 1 ether. Now it worked:

```
12:25 $ truffle deploy --network ropsten
Using network 'ropsten'.

Now my question is: can I submit the project with de ropsten deployment
(it explicity asks for rinkeby)? I have some kind of issue with rinkeby
connection in Metamask. Even when I select it and asks for ether in
https://faucet.metamask.io, the ether is sent do ropsten.

I published the project again in github:
